MOS 6502 emulator and class to be used to tinker with 8-bit computers and build emulations of 8-bit systems. Emulator can be run cycle accurate, stepped through for debugging, or run at max speed. 

## Installation

You can install manjevas-six502 from [PyPi]():

```PowerShell
  pip install manjevas-six502
```
## Features

- Configure RAM
- Configure clock speed
- Official [MOS instruction set](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html)

## Roadmap

- Add `cycle_accurate` support

- Add un-official MOS 6502 instruction set

## How to Use

The emulator can be used standalone or as a module. 

### Standalone
In this mode, the package is run as a CLI application, with access to debug information along with the contents of the monitor being displayed on a 40x30 screen.
